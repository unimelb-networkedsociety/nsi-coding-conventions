# NSI Coding Standard

NSI Lab has provided our coding standards for different programming languages to help you avoid 
1. Spaghetti code (dirt is everywhere)
2. Lasagna code (dirt is between layers) 
3. and Tortelli code (dirt is just inside each piece)

Please find the link below for your preferred language!

### Covered Languages:
1. [Python](docs/python-standard.md)
2. [Swift](docs/swift-standard.md)
3. [C# for Unity](docs/csharp-unity-standard.md)
4. To be continued...

### Writing comments in your project
We don't prefer huge amount of comments because good code should be self explained. But when you think it's needed for example the function will surprise experts or confuse beginners, write comments to explain what does that piece of code do!
