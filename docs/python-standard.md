# Python Programing Style:

* Each file starts with the following format:

        # Author: xxx
		# Date: dd/mm/yy
		# Purpose: purpose of the file

* Indentation : Never mix spaces and tabs. Indent your code blocks with 4 spaces.

* Naming Convention: Function names should be <b>lowercase</b>, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readibility. You can follow the conventions below:
	##### module_name, package_name, ClassName, method_name, ExceptionName, function_name, GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME, global_var_name, instance_var_name, function_parameter_name, local_var_name 

* Line length: Maximum line length is 80 characters.

* TODO Comments: Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.

* Import formating: Imports should be on separate lines.

* Global Variables: Try to avoid global variables.
